Welcome To Mek's Hidden Hangman Game! The Main Difference Is That Instead Of Being Able To See Blank Letters Representing The Words, and They Are Placed In Upon Correct Guesses, It's All A Mystery!

**Note: Where the answer is hidden, you are allowed to use pencil/pen and paper to keep track of your guesses and what the answer may be. This is a basic representation of Hangman which allowed for full user creativity when playing with friends. So clone the repo, get a whiteboard, markers, eraser, and some friends and have fun!
